https://threejs.org/docs/#Manual/Introduction/How_to_run_things_locally

I have used javascript library which allowed me to load FBX file to webgl, it takes the result.fbx created by the dungeon generator and load it to html web page
The FBX loader is new and has no documentation, web devellopers usually work with .json type of files, but i managed to load and display it as an FBX.
