https://threejs.org/docs/#Manual/Introduction/How_to_run_things_locally

I have used javascript library which allowed me to load FBX file to webgl, it takes the result.fbx created by the dungeon generator and load it to the web page

Page is build with html, css and javascript I will add comment to the code to descripe each part separetely.

The FBX loader is new and has no documentation, web devellopers usually work with .json type of files, but i managed to load and display it as an FBX.

The fbx is fully interactive , you can drag rotate and zoom model in your web browser using mouse 

Scroll mouse wheel to zoom in and zoom out, translate dangeon with right mouse button , rotate and drag with left mouse button
